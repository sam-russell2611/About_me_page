        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I love to play guitar, listen to music, watch shows, and learn more about Cybersecurity. I've played guitar since I was really young so it always helps me destress. I love every kind of music, you name a genre and I definetly have some artists that I like from it.</p>

        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>I was a captain on my High school lacrosse team where I was in charge of the teams defense. I've always loved defense so naturally I want to do it as a job, this time with a lot less running though. I was also Vice-president of my School's seminary council where we planned many seminary activities for the whole school.</p>
